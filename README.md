# CKA-Essentials
Resources For The Certified Kubernetes Administrator Exam

Greetings to all Kubernauts! This is part of efforts to help others in acheiving the much coveted Certififed Kubernetes Exam by the Cloud native Foundation.

Pre-requisites:
** You are advised to be familiar with administering a systemd based Linux distribution preferably Ubuntu 16 (the exam uses Ubuntu 16)
** Be familiar with the docker run time environment, this may be needed just in case you need to confirm if contianers are created especially in cases of creating static pods
** Be comfortable with using command line text editors like VI or NANO 
** This is not a beginner exam so to say, you need much practice to be able to master the exam blue prints

The exam blue prints should be followed from time to time, this is a new exam, as such it is expected that some objectives will be changed over time.
